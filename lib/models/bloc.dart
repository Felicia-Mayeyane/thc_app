/// ## Business Logic Component (BLoC)
///
/// A [StatefulWidget] has built-in logic: it can react to user input
/// to change the state of the UI.
///
/// A "Business Logic Component" is code that just handles logic
/// without any direct connection to the UI.
///
/// Stateful widgets are great for lots things, but if you had a stateful widget
/// with a "dark mode" switch, it would only change the theme for that screen,
/// not across the whole app. Flutter tries to be efficient and only rebuild a widget
/// when needed, so you could store the theme mode in a global variable that every widget
/// can access, and it still wouldn't update the other screens right awayâ€”the theme would
/// abruptly change when something else causes other widgets to rebuild.
///
/// Instead of using [State.setState] to update a value, you can use a [Bloc] for state
/// management, and it'll send a stream of data to any widget that needs it.
///
/// The Heart Center is implementing BLoCs using `provider`,
/// along with some classes borrowed from `flutter_bloc`.
///
/// `provider` a dependency in our pubspec.yaml, and the extra BLoC classes are in this file!
